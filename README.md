# Running the Project

1. First pull the project
2. Head to frontend folder, `pnpm i` -> `pnpm run build` -> `pnpm run dev`. You will get a port open with port number `5173`
3. Head to backend folder, `npm i` -> `npm run build` -> `npm run dev`. You will get a port open with port number `3000`

Two ports are basically the same, but `Hot reload` only works with 5173. While `3000` suppose to be your prod env. 
  
That's all for now
