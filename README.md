## Running locally

1. We are going to use npm for backend and pnpm for front end (npm works too, but pnpm is faster and result in lighter node_module).
1. Install dependencies: using `npm i` for backend, `pnpm i` for frontend.
1. Build and run the project:
-Frontend: `pnpm run dev` (port 5173 should be started)
-Backend: `npm run dev` (port 3000 should be started)
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173/`

## Running online
The website can be found at <https://cs476-project.onrender.com/> (it often takes a few minutes to open the webpage the first time, I believe it's because of how OnRender works, like the server need to start up or something)

## Running tests (not complete)
backend: npm run test
front end: pnpm run test
